# Milestone: DDGI in Sponza
  - use skybox in L2
  - think more carefully about equations, energy conservation etc.
  - use some kind of visibility testing (we already have the ray distances!)
  - use textures :DDGI_Textures
  - use CPU constants for size of probe grid and related images :ProbeGrid
  - use a camera-position-dependent probe grid
