# Milestone: DDGI in Sponza
  - use skybox in L2
  - investigate "smooth backface" artifacts
  - investigate "self-lighting"
  - investigate "zero-grid-coord-repeat"
  - investigate why Sponza doesn't work at all, regardless of grid

  - think more carefully about equations, energy conservation etc.
  - use textures :DDGI_Textures

  - use some kind of visibility testing (we already have the ray distances!)
