# Milestone: DDGI in Sponza
  - *** use "lazy" probe maps. ***
  - use texture LODs properly
  - use skybox in L2
  - investigate "smooth backface" artifacts
  - investigate "self-lighting"
  - investigate "zero-grid-coord-repeat"
  - investigate "edge-sponza-wraparound-maybe"

  - think more carefully about equations, energy conservation etc.
  - use some kind of visibility testing (we already have the ray distances!)
