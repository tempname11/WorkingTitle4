# milestone: DDGI
  --- should work well

  - hysteresis: previous probe maps -> new probe maps
  - variable probe grid
  - visibility
  - energy conservation

  --- should work OK in more general scenarios

  :Textures
  :ProbeGrid
  :WorldSpaceNormals

  --- should be functional in current test scene

  :ProbePacking
