# Milestone: great GI in Sponza
  *** use "lazy" probe maps. ***
  *** cascades.              ***
  *** reference ray tracer.  ***

  ... shadows still have "bands" which seem related to "seams" in the octomap.
  ... use texture LODs properly
  ... think more carefully about equations, energy conservation etc. :GI_Equations

  - investigate "self-lighting"
    - first, build probe visualization via spheres in world space.

  ! investigate "zero-grid-coord-repeat"/"edge-sponza-wraparound" bug
