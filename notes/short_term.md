# Milestone: DDGI in Sponza
  - use skybox in L2
  - investigate "smooth backface" artifacts
  - investigate "self-lighting"
  - investigate "zero-grid-coord-repeat"

  - think more carefully about equations, energy conservation etc.
  - use some kind of visibility testing (we already have the ray distances!)

  - use textures
    * LOD stuff
